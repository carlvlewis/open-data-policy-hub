**What is open data?**

[Write a definition of open data.]

**Why bother with open data policy? Why not simply publish data?**

Public policy is essential because it demonstrates public commitment to lasting change. Policy invites the community into the process, ensuring public oversight of the long-term availability of information — even politically charged information — across all city departments, not simply those that volunteer it.

Truly public data demands the oversight and involvement of the public and this can only be solidified through public policy.
