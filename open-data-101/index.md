### What is open data?

<div class="testimonial-blockquote">
Open data is data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike.

### Why bother with open data policy? Why not simply publish data?

Public policy is essential because it demonstrates public commitment to lasting change. Policy invites the community into the process, ensuring public oversight of the long-term availability of information — even politically charged information — across all city departments, not simply those that volunteer it.

Truly public data demands the oversight and involvement of the public and this can only be solidified through public policy.
