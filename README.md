# Open Data Policy Hub

This repository powers the Sunlight Foundationâ€™s [Open Data Policy Hub](https://opendatapolicyhub.sunlightfoundation.com/).

This is a very-customized fork of the [18F website](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov) (inspired by [NYC Planning Labs](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-planninglabs.nyc-archive/blob/master/_posts/2017-06-12-cloning-18f-gsa-gov.md)). Hooray, open source!

Documentation for this site is very important. The bad news is that it's still being written; the good news is that it will be posted soon! Most of this site's design features are documented in the [18F Style Guide](https://18f.gsa.gov/styleguide/).
